# Slider

## A Tiny Slide Show Tool

The problem with PowerPoint and KeyNote and the like is that they
don't really have a good workflow for when you need to produce a quick
presentation in the five minutes before your slot comes up. Too heavy,
too many choices, too much animation and clipart.

**Slider** solves those problems and more with a simple text-oriented
workflow for creating and sharing slide presentations.

## Editing

The Slider edit interface shows a list of your slides down the left,
and a preview of the current slide on the right. As you change text in
the slide list, the preview updates.

## Showing

When you start your presentation, the slide view takes up the full
page. Use your browser's full-screen mode (e.g. [f11] on FireFox) for
best effect. 

Navigation controls are provided on the lower third of the screen, or
you can use the [pgup] and [pgdn] keys to step through the slides.
